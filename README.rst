Puppet building rules for OpenStack images
==========================================

These elements are used to build disk images for deploying OpenStack via Heat.
They are built as part of the TripleO_ umbrella project.

.. _TripleO: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TripleO

Instructions
------------

Checkout this source tree and also the diskimage builder, export an
ELEMENTS_PATH to add elements from this tree, and build any disk images you
need::

    git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/diskimage-builder.git
    git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/tripleo-puppet-elements.git
    export ELEMENTS_PATH=tripleo-puppet-elements/elements
    diskimage-builder/bin/disk-image-create -u base vm bootstrap local-config stackuser heat-cfntools -a i386 -o bootstrap

Common element combinations
---------------------------

Always include heat-cfntools in images that you intend to boot via heat : if
that is not done, then the user ssh keys are not reliably pulled down from the
metadata server due to interactions with cloud-init.

Architecture
------------

OpenStack images are intended to be deployed and maintained using Nova + Heat.

As such they should strive to be stateless, maintained entirely via automation.

Configuration
-------------

In a running OpenStack there are several categories of config.

 - per user - e.g. ssh key registration with nova: we repeat this sort
   of config every time we add a user.
 - local node - e.g. nova.conf or ovs-vsctl add-br br-ex : settings that
   apply individually to machines
 - inter-node - e.g. credentials on rabbitmq for a given nova compute node
 - application state - e.g. 'neutron net-create ...' : settings that
   apply to the whole cluster not on a per-user / per-tenant basis

We have five places we can do configuration in TripleO:
 - image build time
 - in-instance heat-driven (ORC scripts)
 - in-instance first-boot scripts [deprecated]
 - from outside via APIs
 - orchestrated by Heat

Our current heuristic for deciding where to do any particular configuration
step:

 - per user config should be done from the outside via APIs, even for
   users like 'admin' that we know we'll have. Note that service accounts
   are different - they are a form of inter-node configuration.
 - local node configuration should be done via ORC driven by Heat and/or
   configuration management system metadata.
 - inter-node configuration should be done by working through Heat. For
   instance, creating a rabbit account for a nova compute node is something
   that Heat should arrange, though the act of creating is probably done by a
   script on the rabbit server - triggered by Heat - and applying the config is
   done on the compute node by the local node script - again triggered by Heat.
 - application state changes should be done from outside via APIs
 - first-boot scripts should not be used.
